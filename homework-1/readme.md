## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Websites vs Web Applications

A website is mainly informative, whereas a web application is interactive. A college site would be a website, but something like google docs would be a web application. Websites are built using html, java, and css.

### VS Code & Extensions

- we code in this
- preview with live server lets you see/ test your site in a browser while you are working on it
  -prettier helps format the code

### Version Control, Git, & GitHub

- commit makes a snapshot of the code
- you have to add a note
- publish branch pushes code from the computer
- git pull: grabs code from git to the computer
- git push: code goes from the computer to git

### Markdown & Documentation

markdown is used for readme pages. It is common practice to add one for github repositories giving information about the project.

- "#" makes a heading
- "\*\*" makes something bold
- "\*" makes something italic
- "```" plus the coding language to add code snippets
